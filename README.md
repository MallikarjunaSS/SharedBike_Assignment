# Project Name  : Bike Sharing Assignment
> Outline a brief description of your project.
 In bike sharing system, bikes are given to the users for rent or free on short time basis. 
 A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic
 THe company is looking for AI model which will predict demand for bike and what all factors affect the demand. 
 This allows the company to be ready as soon as pandamic restrictions are over

## General Information
- Company is siffering from huge loss dune to co-vid pandamic. During pandamic, there was lock down due to which there was no demand for rented bikes. Compay wants to be ready to handle post pandamic demand for rented bikes. Hence lookig for AI model which find the factors affecting rented bikes demand and to come with demand projections. Using this data Company get be ready to handle the situation better
- Building a model which determines factors affecting the renting of bikes and to predict the demand for rented bikes
- Two years of rented bikes data given in day.csv


## Technologies Used
- library - numpy
- library - pandas
- library - sklearn
- library - matplotlib
- library - seaborn

## Conclusions
- Conclusion 1 : The model 4 build for bike sharing problem is very well 'Generalize' various datasets. 
- Conclusion 2 : temp (Temperature) - A coefficient value of ‘0.5709’ indicates that a unit increase in temp, increases the bike renting by 0.5709 units
- Conclusion 3 : weathersit_3 (Weather Situation 3) - A coefficient value of ‘-0.2439’ indicated that, a unit increase in Weathersit3, decreases the bike renting by 0.2439 units.
- Conclusion 4 : yr (Year) - A coefficient value of ‘0.2294’ indicated that a unit increase in yr increases the bike reting by 0.2294 units.
- Conclusion 5 : windspeed : A coefficient value of ‘-0.1861’ indicated that a unit increase in windspeed variable decreases the bike hire numbers by 0.1861 units.
- Conclusion 6 : hum(Humidity) : A coefficient value of ‘-0.1613’ indicated that a unit increase in hum variable decreases the bike renting by 0.1613 units. 
- Conclusion 7 : season_4 : A coefficient value of ‘0.1407’ indicated that a unit increase in season_4 variable increases the bike rent biking by 0.1407 units
